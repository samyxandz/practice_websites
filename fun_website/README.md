<p>This Folder contains all the code require to build a fun little website .
<br>
This website was made by me to test out basic knowledge in javasciprt along with testing out the DOM api.Making this website helped me immensely to gather information of dom,how dom works,and about the dom tree.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Features of the website:-</h2>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>Random meme generator</li>
    <li>Random jokes generator</li>
    <li>Random quotes generator</li>
    <li>Random riddle generator</li>
</ol>
   The riddle generator was design in such a way that the answer could be shown with another button.<br>
   If the user alreay had an answer or wanter an answer withou generating a riddle,an alert would be thrown.
